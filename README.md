Unity Endless Runner

A 3D lane-based endless runner game built using Unity and C#. 

This project demonstrates gameplay programming fundamentals including:
- Physics-based movement using Rigidbody
- Smooth lane switching system
- Jump mechanics with ground detection
- Mobile joystick input integration
- Coin system with high-score persistence using PlayerPrefs

Features

* Rigidbody-based forward movement

* Smooth lane switching system

* Jump system with ground detection

* Coin collection & high score saving using PlayerPrefs

* Game Over & Restart system

* Mobile joystick input support

* Keyboard input support

Controls

PC:

* Left / Right Arrow – Switch lanes

* Space – Jump

Mobile:

* Joystick – Move left/right

* Jump button – Jump

Tech Stack

* Unity 6

* C#

* Rigidbody Physics

* PlayerPrefs

* UI System

What I Learned

* Implementing lane-based movement using physics

* Handling input systems (keyboard + mobile)

* Managing game states (play, game over, restart)

* Version control using Git & GitHub
